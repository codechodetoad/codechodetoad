# Hi, I'm Phuc Pham 👋

## 🚀 About Me

I'm a Computer Science student at Denison University passionate about **distributed systems** and **high-performance computing**. I love building systems that can handle massive scale while maintaining sub-millisecond latency.

Currently exploring the intersection of low-latency systems, multi-threading, and algorithmic optimization. When I'm not optimizing for throughput, I'm diving into network programming and computer vision projects.

## 💻 Technical Expertise

**Languages:** C++ • Python • Java • C • JavaScript • SQL

**Core Focus Areas:**
- 🌐 Distributed Systems & Multi-threading
- ⚡ Low-Latency & High-Frequency Trading Systems
- 🔧 Performance Optimization & Algorithm Design
- 📊 Data Infrastructure & Database Design
- 👁️ Computer Vision & Network Programming

**Technologies:** Git • Docker • Linux • SQLAlchemy • OpenCV • CMake • libpcap • spdlog

## 🔨 What I Build

- **Scalable distributed applications** processing 500K+ messages/second
- **Real-time analytics platforms** with multi-tier architectures
- **High-performance trading systems** with sub-millisecond latency
- **Data pipelines** with continuous integration and 98%+ accuracy

## 🌟 Current Interests

- Lock-free data structures and concurrent programming
- Message queuing systems and stream processing
- Architectural tradeoffs in distributed environments
- Zero-copy techniques and memory-mapped I/O
